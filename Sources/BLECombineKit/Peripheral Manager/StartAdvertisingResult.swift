  /// In most cases it happens when app went from background with ongoing advertising - in that case you will receive `RestoredAdvertisementData` param, so you can know with what `advertisementData` it was started before app went background.
  /// WARNING: remember that this is not really calling `CBPeripheralManager.startAdvertising`
  /// so it might be not started with `advertisementData` param that you've provided. If you
  /// want to start with different `advertisementData` then you will need to dispose
  /// advertising observable and call `startAdvertising` again.
