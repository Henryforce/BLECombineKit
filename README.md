## Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
To integrate CombineBluetoothKit into your Xcode project using Carthage  specify it in your `Cartfile`:
```swift
github "Henryforce/BLECombineKit"
```
Then, run `carthage update` to build framework and drag `CombineBluetoothKit.framework` into your Xcode project.
